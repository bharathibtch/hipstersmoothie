  title: 'How to set up a Github Pages for your user account'
}

This post aims to outline the steps one must take to publish and manage a Github Pages website for your user account.

Goals:

- Host source code on Github
- Use `your-username.github.io` to host the page
- Use custom domain

This website was made using the following technique.

# 1. Setup source repository

Set up a repository that contains the files used to build your website. It doesn't really matter how you build it but it must output a directory with all the static files needed to serve your website. For this post I will be using `next.js` as an example static website generator.

# 2. Setup github.io repository

This repository will be used for hosting your build website. This is what will be served on `your-username.github.io`.

Set it as a remote for you source code repository:

```sh
git add remote github-io https://github.com/your-username/your-username.github.io
```

# 3. Install `push-dir`

We are going to need to push our project to github somehow. I've found that `push-dir` is a great tool with a simple interface.

```sh
yarn add push-dir
```

# 4. Setup deployment script

Add a deploy script to your project.

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "deploy": "next build && next export && touch out/.nojekyll && push-dir --dir=out --branch=master --cleanup --verbose --remote=github-io"
  }
}
```

## Important steps:

### build

You must first build your website in some way. Here we run `next build` and `next export`.

### .nojekyll

Since the `next.js` website creates some folder with `_` in the name we need to include a `.nojekyll`. If you build process produces folder or files with underscore you need to do this too.

### push-dir

Finally this is where the magic happens. After we have built the website we use `push-dir` to push the output directory to the `github-io`'s master branch.

Now we have successfully published to `your-username.github.io`

# 5. Setup custom domain

Follow [this guide](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-an-apex-domain-and-www-subdomain/) on how to add the correct IPs to your DNS.

Once you have done that we need to generate a CNAME file for our custom domain and make sure that it gets included in the out directory that is pushed to github-io.

Add the following to scripts (for `next.js` we put the CNAME in the `out` directory):

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "create:cname": "touch out/CNAME && echo \"your.com\" >> out/CNAME",
    "deploy": "next build && next export && && npm run create:cname && touch out/.nojekyll && push-dir --dir=out --branch=master --cleanup --verbose --remote=github-io"
  }
}
```

## Enable HTTPS on Github

Go to the settings page for your `your-username.github.io` repository and check the `Enforce HTTPS` option.

# All done!

That's it! Now you have a static website managed through github with a custom domain
