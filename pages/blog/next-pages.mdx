Getting `next.js` to work on a domain at anything other than the root takes a little extra configuration. This post will walk you though the steps to get it up and running.

## Prefix Static Assets

Github project pages urls are deployed to `https://your-username.github.io/your-project`. To get `next.js` to properly serve all of your assets (js, css, html) your must include a `assetPrefix` in your `next.config.js`.

```js
const debug = process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production';
const assetPrefix = debug ? '' : '/your_prefix/';

module.exports = {
  assetPrefix
};
```

Now you will find that when you deploy your project website to github pages all the static assets work, but if you try clicking anything using the `@next/link` component you'll get a 404. If you have any pages with images served from the static folder you will also notice that they do not work either!

## Prefix URLs

So it seems to get our github project page to work we'll also need to all the URLs in our app to be prefixed. This includes both anchor `href`s and img `src`s. You could do this yourself, or you could install [`next-prefixed`](https://github.com/hipstersmoothie/next-prefixed) a package I published to address this issue.

### Configure

First install `next-prefixed` and add the following to your `next.config.js`.

```js
const debug = process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production';
const assetPrefix = debug ? '' : '/your_prefix/';

module.exports = withPlugins([withCSS, withMDX, withBlog], {
  assetPrefix,
  publicRuntimeConfig: {
    assetPrefix
  }
});
```

`publicRuntimeConfig` will expose the `assetPrefix` to our `next.js` app.

### Usage

Now that you have fully configured your `assetPrefix` all thats left to do is switch out all `@next/link` components and `img` tags with the prefixed versions.

```js
import { Link, Image } from 'next-prefixed';

const Example = () => (
  <div>
    <Image src="/static/jimp.png" alt='Code example' />
    <Link href="/blog" />
  </div>
);
```

These components use `assetPrefix` to prefix all the URLs so they resolve in your github-pages app correctly. Now your project page links work!

### Manual Prefix

If you need to manually prefix some URLs that aren't covered by `next-prefixed`'s components, it also exports `prefixUrl`. This function simply joins the `assetPrefix` with whatever path is supplied to it.

```js
import { prefixURL } from 'next-prefixed';

prefixURL('/blog'); // => my_prefix/blog
```

# All done!

Now your github project page should work with `next.js` without a flaw!
